        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/skand08/GeoSpatial-AI">GeoSpatial-AI</a> - Geospatial AI refers to the application of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze and interpret geospatial data, which includes data with a geographic component such as satellite imagery, maps, and geographic information system (GIS) data. It combines AI algorithms with spatial data analysis. </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/skand08/Medicine_Recommender">Medicine_Recommender</a> - This project recommends medicine and various predictions based on your symptoms. </li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/skand08/Customer-Personality-Analysis">Customer-Personality-Analysis</a> - This project aims to perform customer segmentation by analyzing customer data using exploratory data analysis (EDA), profiling, and unsupervised learning techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments to help the business better understand its customers, their habits, behavior, and needs. Customer segmentation allows the company to tailor products, services, and marketing strategies for different customer groups, optimizing business outcomes.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/skand08/Logistics_Routing_Problem">Logistics_Routing_Problem</a> - The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem that focuses on efficiently routing a fleet of vehicles to deliver goods or services to a set of locations. The objective is to determine the most cost-effective routes for the trucks while satisfying various constraints i.e. equal time taken, balanced distances traveled, etc. </li>
